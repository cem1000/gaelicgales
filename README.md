# This program creates weather-inspired tweets in the style of famous Irish literary figures and generates related images using DALL-E. It features:

Random selection of Irish literary figures and art styles.
Weather data collection for specific locations.
Generation of tweets using the OpenAI API.
DALL-E image creation based on the tweet.
Integration with Google Sheets for data logging.
It includes functions for initializing APIs, utility operations (e.g., weather data parsing, art style randomization), tweet and image generation, and Google Sheets operations. To run, ensure API credentials are set, have a counties.csv file ready, and execute the process_all_counties('counties.csv') function with necessary modules installed.
